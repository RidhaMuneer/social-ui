# Social Media App - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of the Social Media App! This project is built using modern web technologies and is currently under development. The app provides social media functionalities such as posting, liking, commenting, and following users. Additionally, a real-time chat feature using PeerJS is being developed.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** - Fast build tool for modern web applications
- **React** - UI library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Statically typed JavaScript for better maintainability
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **Websockets** - peer-to-peer communication for real-time chat

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:RidhaMuneer/social-ui.git
   cd social-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables (VITE_PUBLIC_API_DEV=API_URL).

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev  # or yarn dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173/` (default Vite port).

## API Integration
